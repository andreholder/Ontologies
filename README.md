# Ontologies
README file

This program is designed to provide metadata about two Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) GEM files from their website (https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2018-ICD-10-CM-and-GEMs.html.)
Download these files from there, or from my Github repo (https://github.com/andreholder)

Once the GEM files and this program have been saved locally, open an Anaconda shell and run the program. The path to the local folder containing the GEM files will be the only argument. 
(NOTE 1: The GEM files must be saved in the same folder for the program to work.)
(NOTE 2: Avoid saving files to path names with spaces.)

Your run commmand should resemble the following: python ontologyMapHWScript.py <path to the gemfile>
